Types of Selenium waits:
1. implicit
2. explicit
3. fluent

1. Implicit Wait or Global Wait
    Applied for findElements() methods;
    waits for a set amount of time before throwing an exception;
    if found within the time, the remaining time is disregarded

 2. Explicit Wait or WebDriver wait
    It is used to tell the WebDriver to wait for a certain condition to be met before throwing an Exception
    (for that specified condition)
    Works with ExpectedConditions class (from Selenium Library) and waits until a certain condition or a given amount
    of time has passed
