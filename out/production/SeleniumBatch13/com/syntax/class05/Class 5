                     Checkboxes and RadioButtons

Handling Checkboxes and RadioButtons:

            Two ways:

    1. If we only have one checkbox or radiobutton, we locate it and click on it
    2. If we have multiple elements/choices we store them to a list, loop through them and then use if condition

// Whenever we use findElements and store it in a list, it will automatically be converted into an arrayList
When we are identifying multiple elements they don't need to be unique--> checkboxes on syntaxproject.com

--> CheckboxDemo class

The logic is identical for RadioButtons



        Dropdown menus

    - list or a menu of options
    - it gives us an opportunity to select one or more options

        Two types of drop down menus:

    1. single select
    2. multiple select

         Ways to handle dropdowns:
    1. click on dropdown and click on option
    2. using Select class (built-in class)
    In order to use Select class we need to make sure that it has a select tag

         Selecting an option from a dropdown can be done in 3 ways:

    1. by index
    2. by visible text
    3. by value
