                    Frames

Frames are separate independent windows in our webpage

All the frames are embeded in the dom (they will all be located in the body of the page, not separate)

If we want to access elements within the frame we have to switch focus to the frame because the focus is initially on the main page
The frame is located on the main page but elements within the frame are not in the main page but in the frame (iframe)

We can handle frames in Selenium with the help of following methods :

1. switchTo().frame(frameNumber)
This method uses the frame id as the parameter. The index of frame id starts from 0.
NoSuchFrameException is thrown if the frame is not found.
2. switchTo().frame(frameName or frame id)
This method uses the frame name as defined by the developer as the parameter.
The frame name is considered a String and is enclosed in quotes. NoSuchFrameException is thrown if the frame is not found.
3. switchTo().frame(WebElement)
This method uses the webElement as the parameter. NoSuchFrameException is thrown if the frame is not found.
StaleElementReferenceException if the frame is no longer active.


We cannot switch focus directly from frame to frame, we have to switch from frame to default and then to another frame
