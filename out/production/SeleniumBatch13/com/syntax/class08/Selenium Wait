Types of Selenium waits:
1. implicit
2. explicit
3. fluent

1. Implicit Wait or Global Wait
    Applied for findElements() methods;
    waits for a set amount of time before throwing an exception;
    if found within the time, the remaining time is disregarded

 2. Explicit Wait or WebDriver wait
    It is used to tell the WebDriver to wait for a certain condition to be met before throwing an Exception
    (for that specified condition)
    Works with ExpectedConditions class (from Selenium Library) and waits until a certain condition or a given amount
    of time has passed

*** A shortcut in xpath when we know tags can change frequently is to use a star* instead of tagName
       driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[contains(text(), 'Welcome')]"));

3. Fluent wait
    Slightly outdated, not commonly used
    Also considered a global wait
    Tells the driver to wait for certain condition to be met, as well as its frequency, before throwing an exception


    Implicit wait - wait to locate an element
    Explicit wait - wait until a condition is met
    Fluent wait - sets a timeout, polling time (frequency of checking) and ignores needed exception in the given time
