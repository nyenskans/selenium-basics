A process of bringing the speed of one or more components to the same level
In this case we are bringing our script and page load to the same speed

Thread.sleep() --> static wait/ unconditional wait (we just pause execution for some time, not dependant on some condition)


Types of Selenium waits:
1. implicit
2. explicit
3. fluent

1. Implicit wait
    - Tells the web driver to wait a certain amount of time before throwing an exception.
    - Only written once, applied to the whole session of your execution
    - Also called a global wait
    - Works with .findElements() method
    - Usually set for 20 seconds, if the elements is found in less than the time set, the script  will continue with the
     execution right away, regardless of the time left (the remaining time will be ignored)
    - If the element is not found within the set time, only then Selenium will throw an Exception
    --> e.g. No Element found/ No such Element exception
