            Window Handling

Handling multiple windows/tabs:

To be able to handle multiple tabs we will be using 2 methods:
1. getWindowHandle();
2. getWindowHandles();

WindowHandle is a unique ID assigned to a specific window/tab ( holds an address of a window/tab )
It is an approximately 40 alphanumeric character long ID (dataType String)

We need these ids to be able to switch between tabs

Once we have multiple tabs open, we will use method getWindowHandles() to get all of their ids.
We store them in a Set (because it doesn't allow duplicate values) and then use Iterator to loop through all of them

The first tab we opened it will be called parent handle; the new tabs are child handles
