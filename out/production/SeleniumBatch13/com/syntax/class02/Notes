Web elements:

Anything we see on the webpage- links, buttons, textBoxes (fields to type something in), pictures, etc

For us to start interacting with elements : right click --> inspect page--> dom shows in the bottom of the page
 dom-->(browser's internal view of the webpage)

--> it's in html (hyper text markup language)

DOM--> Document Object Model --> internal view of the webpage (also called Developer's (dev) tools)
Document --> a simple html documents represents the page we're inspecting
Object--> any line in the page is an object
Model --> it's just a layout

Inside <body> on the page--> whenever something is highlighted it means the code refers to the highlighted area
Whenever the color changes, it means it's the next line

command+shift+c (or cursor) to select a certain element on the page--> select an element--> line of code in dom gets highlighted
:--> dock location

To work with those elements in selenium we must identify the locators first
8 Locators:

1. ID
2. Name
3. TagName
4. ClassName
    ---> attributes
5. LinkText
6. PartialLinkText
7. CssSelectors
8. xpath


In the element we should look for ID first because it is unique (most of the time)
Most elements have multiple locators (for example class, id, name etc)


Any locators we see on elements are considered attributes (name, tabindex, type, class etc)
If there are numbers in ID or class, we should use a different locator

purple words are Tag names (tags)



        Why do we need so many locators?

-Some locators have duplicate (same) values in different elements, so it is good to have multiple
(example class="txt"--> common value for class in a lot of elements--> selenium will only interact the first element it locates)
--developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
--some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
 (example linkText and partialLinkText are only available for links)

 a tag is also called anchor tag
