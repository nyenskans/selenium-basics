                        Calendars

Also called date-pickers

How to Handle Calendars:

1. click on the calendar
2. locate the month and get the text
3. if the desired text is not visible --> we keep clicking on next and keep updating month text
4. as soon as we find our desired text --> get all the cells from the table (days)
5. loop through cells
6. once the cell value is matched with our condition--> click on the matched date
