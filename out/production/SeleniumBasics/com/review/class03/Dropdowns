1. Single select dropdowns (Static dropdowns)
2. Multiselect dropdowns (Dynamic dropdown)

How to deal with a dropdown:
1. inspect dropdown to see if it has Select tag if  yes proceed with step 2.
2. write the locator to get this particular dropdown in selenium
3. create an object of Select class
4. store all the objects in a list
5. loop through the list and choose the desired option


If it has a select tag we can use select class from Selenium and we can select a desired option by one of 3 ways:
1. by index
2. by value
3. by visible text
