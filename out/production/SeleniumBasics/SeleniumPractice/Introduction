WebDriver is an interface with all the method names (it's just pushing the contracts on to the classes
 and they have to implement all the methods). It enforces the contract for a class to follow.

 Every Browser comes with one class--> all methods have same names, different implementation. They have all implemented
 WebDriver methods and all their own personal methods
