                        Frames

Frames are separate and independent windows on the webpage. (usually with different content)
They allow developers to represent multiple different views on one webpage.

 To see how many frames we have on the page, we look them up int the DOM by //iframe (we may or may not see them on the page
 but they are located in the dom)
 In order to interact with them in Selenium, we need to switch our focus on to the frames as well.
 (Each iframe has another page with <html> tag)

We use .switchTo().frame() method to switch the focus to the frame

 3 ways to switch focus to a frame:
    1. By index  .frame(index)
    2. By name/id .frame("name"/"id")
    3. By using WebElement .frame(WebElement)

To be able to interact with WebElements in frames, first we have to switch to the frame in which it's located
If we try to locate the WebElement before switching, we will get an error : no such element, even though the locator is correct

-Once we are done dealing with one frame, we have to switch back to the main page (or parent frame):
    driver.switchTo().defaultContent();

*3.  When we are switching the focus to the frame by WebElement : the frame itself is a WebElement in a webpage,
so we locate it just like any other WebElement


* Interview question:
How do you handle alerts in Selenium?
* Answer: by using (methods from) Alert interface

** Alert interface doesn't get implemented by any class
