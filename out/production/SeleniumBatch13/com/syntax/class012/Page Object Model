POM is a design pattern which allows us to enhance the maintenance and reduce code duplicarion

        Advantages:
1. Code reusability
2. Code maintanablity
3. Object repository
4. Readability

       2 ways to implement POM:
1. POM without PageFactory
1. POM with PageFactory


                4 packages:

1. TESTBASE
       - initialize the driver
       - open browser
       - close browser

2. Pages
    - all the web pages in form of classes and all it's WebElements:
    - LoginPage (username, password, loginButton)
    - *etc (we can perform actions on them)

3. Tests
    -*(combines all 3 other packages and performing tests)
    - LoginPageTest (actions on the page) <-- call methods, import WebElements etc
    - actions like send keys, click, verifications
    - call methods from TESTBASE and UTILS (extend or make object of class)
    - get WebElements from PAGES
4. Utils
        - commonMethods (that we can reuse)
        - ReadingProperties
        - ExcelProperties
