WebDriver is an interface
Interfaces are abstract classes in which we only have abstract classes

        Advantages of Selenium WebDriver:
1. open-source
2. works with different browsers, supports cross browsing testing
3. works with different operating systems
4. supports different programming languages--java, python, ruby, js


        Disadvantages:
1. cannot test desktop applications (only web based)
2. no technical support
3. no built in reports
4. cannot test images, videos and captcha-s (we have to test those manually)

        get() vs navigate()

-navigate() can go back, forward and refresh a page
-get() waits for the page to fully load, whereas navigate() doesn't
-get () will not keep the history of the browser, navigate() will (in the history bar in the browser)


        close() vs quit()

-close() closes the current single tab
-quit() closes the entire browser


       fullscreen() vs maximize()

-maximizes the page but we still see the control panel(back, forward, bookmarks)
-fullscreen() takes up the whole screen, we don't see the control panel
