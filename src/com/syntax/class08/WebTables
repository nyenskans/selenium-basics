                                    WebTables:

Webtables are elements on the web page, which consist of rows, columns and headers (sometimes)

Types of WebTables:
1. Static WebTables (doesn't change)
2. Dynamic WebTables (changes in size (+- number of rows/columns))

WebTables consist of different sections or parts in html:
<table>
    <thead>             (table header)
        <tr>            (table row)
            <th></th> -- column data or heading data (what the header row consists of)
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>             (table body)
        <tr>            (table rows in the body)
            <td></td> -- table data (in each row)
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
In some cases there won't be <thead> (header), but instead the header will be in the table body

<th> header data (columns)
<td> table data (in the body)

To data from WebTables, we need to store it in a List (just the data)
