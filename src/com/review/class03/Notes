1. Single select dropdowns (Static dropdowns)
2. Multiselect dropdowns (Dynamic dropdown)

How to deal with a dropdown:
1. inspect dropdown to see if it has Select tag if  yes proceed with step 2.
2. write the locator to get this particular dropdown in selenium
3. create an object of Select class
4. store all the objects in a list
5. loop through the list and choose the desired option


If it has a select tag we can use select class from Selenium and we can select a desired option by one of 3 ways:
1. by index
2. by value
3. by visible text


Multiselect vs singleSelect:

1. MultiSelect we can select more than 1 option
2. has deselect option




            Alerts

PopUps that take the focus away from the browser
We need to handle the alert in order to proceed with automation

1.html alerts--> web-based--> we can inspect them and deal with them in regular manner
2. js--> browser alerts--> driver.switchTo().alert()   .dismiss()/.accept()
3. window based alerts--> we cannot deal with them in selenium
