                                  Alerts


Alert is a pop up message. They take focus away from our main page that we are on
We cannot proceed further until it is handled.

3 Types of alert:

1. Web based alerts(pop up) / HTML alerts - can be inspected and we can perform actions on them
2. js based alerts / browser alerts - cannot be inspected, we can handle them by using switchTo method
3. window based alerts - cannot be handled by Selenium / desktop application pop up
(example when you are uploading a file to a web page, a window of our system pops up for us to choose a file)

* captcha pop ups can't be handled

Types of javascript alerts:
1. simple alert - we can only click OK button
2. confirmation alert - offers 2 options - ok/cancel
3. prompt alert - has input field and ok / we can enter text and click OK or cancel

To handle js alerts we only have 4 methods:

1. .accept() - click ok/accept
2. .dismiss() - click no/cancel
3. .getText() - get the message of the pop up
4. .sendKeys() - enter text (for prompt alert)


*AuthenticationAlert:
 These types of alerts show up as soon as the page loads--> pops up and gives us a field to enter password/username
 to be able to access the website:
 Handled by inserting password and username in the url right after // in the format: username:password@
 Similar to a js alert, but not the same because it is handled without using the Alert interface or .switchTo() method.
